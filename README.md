[00:11.93] Baby, you should let me be your pretty little psycho
[00:14.86] You say that I'm crazy
[00:16.43] I say "baby, I know"
[00:17.96] Once I got you with me, there's no going home
[00:20.81] They will never be missed
[00:22.50] All these other stupid hoes
[00:36.00] 
[00:24.35] I know it feels so wrong
[00:27.29] But it just feels so right
[00:30.39] Don't worry 'bout the other guys
[00:33.35] I'll make sure that they die
[00:47.35] 
[00:47.84] I'm batshit insane, I'm so obsessive
[00:50.95] Killing anyone that tries to give you affection
[00:53.95] They better run away or I will teach them a lesson
[00:57.04] I want you to be the only one that I'm sexing
[00:59.98] I wanna know where you are, I'm keeping your location
[01:03.15] Pour your blood in my cup and I just drank it
[01:06.01] I just want your body
[01:07.67] I just wanna taste it
[01:09.23] Let's forget the others
[01:10.52] They are so basic
[01:19.02] 
[01:15.04] They can run and hide, but I'm still gonna find them
[01:21.37] Baby, if you leave me, I'm gonna fucking die then
[01:45.87] 
[01:24.28] Baby, you should let me be your pretty little psycho
[01:27.19] You say that I'm crazy
[01:28.79] I say "baby, I know"
[01:30.33] Once I got you with me, there's no going home
[01:33.22] They will never be missed
[01:34.89] All these other stupid hoes
[01:48.39] 
[01:36.68] I know it feels so wrong
[01:39.50] But it just feels so right
[01:42.60] Don't worry 'bout the other guys
[01:45.86] I'll make sure that they die
[01:59.86]

[01:58.98] All these other stupid hoes
[02:12.48] 
[02:00.78] Baby, you know I can be a little obsessive
[02:03.87] Wanna fuck me all night, you can be my best friend
[02:06.77] You call it stalking and I call it true love
[02:10.27] I'll be outside your house till you fucking show up
[02:12.82] I can be your scary boy whenever you want
[02:16.02] I'll kill him if you ask, just tell me you're in love
[02:18.96] I'll hide his fucking corpse, so you never find it
[02:22.15] I'd do anything for you
[02:23.49] Baby, just please don't go
[02:36.49] 
[02:25.05] I know it feels so wrong
[02:27.99] But it just feels so right
[02:30.83] Don't worry 'bout the other guys
[02:33.99] I'll make sure that they die
[02:47.99]
